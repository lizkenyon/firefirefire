## Calculation Logic

### Coast FIRE Formula
```
Coast FIRE Number = Annual Retirement Spending / (SWR × (1 + real return rate)^years to retirement)
```

### Real Return Rate
```
Real Return Rate = Investment Rate of Return - Inflation Rate
```

### Regular FIRE Formula
```
FIRE Number = Annual Retirement Spending / Safe Withdrawal Rate
```

## Key Concepts

**Coast FIRE**: The point where your investments will grow to support traditional retirement without additional contributions.

**FIRE Number**: The total amount needed to retire, calculated using the safe withdrawal rate.

**Safe Withdrawal Rate**: The percentage of your portfolio you can withdraw annually in retirement (typically 4%).

**Real Return Rate**: Investment returns adjusted for inflation.
